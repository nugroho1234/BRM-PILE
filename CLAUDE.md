# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

PT. BRM PILE official website - A static website built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript showcasing precast concrete products and company information. The website is designed to match the exact specifications from the design PDF.

## Technology Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup
- **CSS3**: Custom styling with Poppins font from Google Fonts
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Smooth scrolling, form handling, and interactive features
- **No build tools required**: Simple bash script for deployment preparation

## Project Structure

```
BRM PILE/
├── src/           # Source files
│   ├── index.html # Main HTML (single-page application)
│   ├── styles.css # Complete styling with responsive design
│   └── script.js  # Interactive features and form handling
├── assets/        # All images, logos, icons (referenced from HTML)
├── dist/          # Built files ready for deployment (generated by build.sh)
└── build.sh       # Build script that copies files to dist/
```

## Common Commands

### Development
```bash
# Run local development server
npm run dev
# or
python3 -m http.server 8001 --directory src
# Then open http://localhost:8001
```

### Build for Production
```bash
# Build the website (copies files to dist/)
npm run build
# or
./build.sh
```

### Test Production Build
```bash
# Serve the built files
npm run serve
# or
python3 -m http.server 8001 --directory dist
```

## Architecture Notes

### Single-Page Design
- All content is on one page ([index.html](src/index.html))
- Navigation uses smooth scrolling to different sections (Hero, About, Products, Contact, etc.)
- Sections are identified by IDs: `#home`, `#about`, `#products`, `#contact`

### CSS Structure
- [styles.css](src/styles.css) is organized by sections (Header, Hero, About, Products, etc.)
- Uses CSS custom properties (variables) for colors and consistent theming
- Responsive breakpoints: 992px (tablet), 768px (mobile), 480px (small mobile)
- Mobile-first approach with hamburger menu

### JavaScript Features
- Smooth scroll navigation with offset for sticky header
- Active navigation highlighting based on scroll position
- Mobile menu toggle
- Scroll reveal animations for cards
- Static form handling (ready for Web3Forms integration)

### Image References
- All images are referenced relative to the HTML file location
- Path pattern: `../assets/filename.png` (from src/index.html)
- After build, paths are maintained in dist/ directory

## Color Scheme (Brand Guidelines)

```css
--primary-red: #E31E24    /* Primary brand color */
--dark-bg: #1a1a1a        /* Dark sections */
--white: #FFFFFF          /* Light sections */
--light-gray: #F5F5F5     /* Background accents */
--text-gray: #666666      /* Body text */
--text-dark: #333333      /* Headings */
```

## Website Sections (in order)

1. **Header** - Sticky navigation with logo, menu, "Let's Talk" CTA
2. **Hero** - Main headline, description, hero image
3. **Info Bar** - Email, address, operating hours
4. **About** - Company history, stats, vision & mission
5. **Why Choose** - 4 strength cards with ISO certifications
6. **Products** - 6 product cards with images and specs
7. **Portfolio** - Project showcase image grid
8. **Contact** - Form (static, ready for Web3Forms) + contact image
9. **Footer** - Company info, contact details, social links

## Important Implementation Details

### Contact Form (Web3Forms Integration Pending)
- Form is currently static with JavaScript alert
- To integrate Web3Forms:
  1. Add `action="https://api.web3forms.com/submit"` to form
  2. Add `method="POST"` to form
  3. Add hidden input: `<input type="hidden" name="access_key" value="YOUR_KEY">`
  4. Update JavaScript in [script.js](src/script.js) to handle Web3Forms response

### Responsive Behavior
- Desktop (>992px): Full grid layouts, horizontal navigation
- Tablet (768-992px): 2-column grids, condensed layouts
- Mobile (<768px): Single column, hamburger menu, stacked content

### Asset Management
- All assets must remain in `assets/` folder
- Images are not optimized/compressed (consider optimization for production)
- No lazy loading implemented (consider adding for performance)

## Deployment

The `dist/` folder contains everything needed for deployment:
- Upload entire `dist/` contents to web root
- No server-side processing required
- Works on any static hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, traditional hosting)

## Future Enhancements Roadmap

- [ ] Integrate Web3Forms for contact form email delivery
- [ ] Add actual product catalog PDF for download
- [ ] Implement image lazy loading for performance
- [ ] Add SEO meta tags and Open Graph tags
- [ ] Create sitemap.xml and robots.txt
- [ ] Add Google Analytics or privacy-friendly alternative
- [ ] Consider adding animation library (AOS, GSAP) for richer interactions
